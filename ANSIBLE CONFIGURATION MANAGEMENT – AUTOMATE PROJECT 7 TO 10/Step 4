RUN FIRST ANSIBLE TEST

Step 7 – Run first Ansible test
Now, it is time to execute ansible-playbook command and verify if your playbook actually works:


```
ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build-number>/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build-number>/archive/playbooks/common.yml
```

Note: Previous command we ran without sudo, this is because we had added an ssh key to ssh-agent for our regular user. If you try to run this command with sudo you will
have to explicitly pass the ssh key with --private-key <path-to-private-key> parameter.

You can go to each of the servers and check if wireshark has been installed by running which wireshark or wireshark --version

Your updated with Ansible architecture now looks like this:

Optional step – Repeat once again
Update your ansible playbook with some new Ansible tasks and go through the full checkout -> change codes -> commit -> PR -> merge -> build -> ansible-playbook cycle again 
to see how easily you can manage a servers fleet of any size with just one command!

Congratulations
You have just automated your routine tasks by implementing your first Ansible project! There is more exciting projects ahead, so lets keep it moving!
